# Instructions
This will require modifying the server.js file and the website/app.js file. You can see index.html for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use style.css to style your application to customized perfection.

# Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use tests.js as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
